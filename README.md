#### How to install your application and all dependencies?

- In order for the webpage to run properlly we need to install dependencies for both the frontend and backend. After the folder is installed in your computer, do a "npm install" on the main folder to download the dependencies for the backend. Then "cd client" to go into the client folder and do "npm install" to install the dependencies for the frontend. After all the dependencies are installed, do "cd .." to go back to the main folder. Then to run the webpage type "npm run dev" this starts both the server for the backend and the react scripts for the frontend.
