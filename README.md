Your Developer Manual covers:
        How to install your application and all dependencies
        How to run your application on a server
        How to run any tests you have written for your software
        The API for your server application - all GET, POST, PUT, etc endpoints, and what they each do
        A clear set of expectations around known bugs and a road-map for future development.




                            
May need to install dependencies if the libraries do not import

***before you do any thing***
do "npm install" on the main folder to install all dependencies for backend

Then go to terminal and cd client then do "npm install" to install all dependencies for frontend
then wait a few minutes to finish installing everythin


To start both the server and react fronend do "npm run dev" on the main home folder.

go to http://localhost:5500/api
