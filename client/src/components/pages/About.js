            We are creating an interactive map that plots the location of
            libraries, recreation centers, fire stations, and police stations
            within Prince Georgeâ€™s (PG) county. We want to explore how these
            facilities are allocated in order to determine if the people of PG
            county have similar services and access. We want to see if there are
            certain neighborhoods in PG county that are underrepresented. With
            this tool, we hope to highlight any inconsistencies and help the
            county make better decisions regarding future projects.

              What we will learn through the process of research and creating
              this tool is whether there is a problem with the allocation of
              facilities in the county. If we identify a problem we will be able
              to propose which neighborhoods should be more fairly split or
              built such that everyone has the same access to the services.
